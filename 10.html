    <h1>Staying Consistent and Adapting to Change</h1>
    <p>Consistency and adaptation are both crucial elements in navigating through life's challenges. While consistency provides stability and reliability, adaptation allows for growth and resilience.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 1: Fitness Journey</h2>
    <p>Consider a person on a fitness journey aiming to lose weight. Consistency in their workout routine and dietary habits is essential to see progress over time. However, as they encounter plateaus or changes in their body's response, they must adapt their approach by tweaking their exercise regimen or adjusting their diet to continue making progress.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 2: Business Strategy</h2>
    <p>In the business world, staying consistent with brand messaging and customer service standards builds trust and loyalty among customers. However, when market conditions shift or new competitors emerge, a company must adapt its strategies by exploring new marketing channels, innovating products, or adjusting pricing strategies to remain competitive.</p>
